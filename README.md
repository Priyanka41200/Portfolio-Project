# Portfolio-Project
The project is using stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) originally taken from Yahoo Finance. The time frame of the dataset is from 12/12/1980 to 24/03/2022. To reduce the data burden, the analysis only includes stock market information from 2010 onwards. The input variables are Open, High, Low, Close, adj. Close and Volume in USD. Using the data described above, we have calculated technical indicators such as exponential moving average, simple moving average, relative strength index and moving average convergence/divergence to predict the following dayâ€™s closing price for Apple Inc. We have chosen to implement a LightGBM regressor due to fast training speeds and high performance.  We employed Bayesian optimisation to identify optimal hyperparameters for the LightGBM model such as learning rate, number of boosted trees, maximum tree leaves, maximum tree depth, max number of bins etc. From the project, we have seen a decrease in the test RMSE of the LightGBM model from 1.52 to 1.41 after hyperparameter tuning.
